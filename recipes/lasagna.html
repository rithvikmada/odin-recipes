    <h1>World's Best Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.webp" alt="A cut out piece of lasagna">
    <h4>In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey in search of the best lasagna recipe. Her ideal here has an intensely flavored sauce, cheeses melted into creaminess as if they were bechamel, meat thatâ€™s just chunky enough and noodles that put up no resistance to the fork.</h4>
    <p>To prepare lasagna from scratch, you start by making sauce, then layer it with wide, flat lasagna noodles and cheese before baking. The sauces can vary from tomato-based sauce, with or without meat, to creamy bechamel sauce, which works well with a wide variety of vegetables.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
        <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
    </ol>
